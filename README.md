# dotfiles

## Disclaimer
This isn't really made for others to use -- it's actually just a backup/way of synchronizing.

Feel free to do what you want with it.

Organized with stow (for now).

## IMPORTANT

Even though this is called rice, be sure to clone it as dotfiles, as I think some of the stuff depends on it.
